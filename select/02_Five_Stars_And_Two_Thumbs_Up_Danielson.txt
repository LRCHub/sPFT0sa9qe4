Thank you
For lending me your hand
For sharing time today
For giving that idea

That made
It a nice and easy day

So saying now thank you
For setting all aside
To treat me to some time

With you
Where all you do

Is listen hard
In my backyard

Now thank you
For lending me your hand
For sharing time today

And I pray that all your hopes
And dreams will fall in your place
And I pray that all your hopes
And dreams will fall in your place

And I pray that all your hopes
And dreams will fall in your place
And I pray that all your hopes
And dreams will fall in your place

Thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks
Thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks
Thanks, thanks, thanks
