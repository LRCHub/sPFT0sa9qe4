Don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
A hint of the scents then it's gone
Look at the state of you, you're all fingers & thumbs
So who's your latest flame
Driving 'em wild in the fast lane
I won't say I told you so, but the boy has no shame

Once when my hands were full
We were double or quits then some
Nothing at all to show for a love so precious

Gone & blown it all, how can you say
"IT DOESN'T MATTER MUCH TO ME"
A dumb mistake, too much to pay
A shattered heart in love's debris

Gone & blown it all, and then you say
"THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING TO ME"
A dumb mistake, too much to pay
A shattered heart in love's debris

Don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
The thrill of the chase, then it's gone
Only the hurt to prove that it ever went on
And life is a wonderful thing
When you're humming the words to a love song
Do what you wanna do, be who you want to be

When I'm in your arms I'm strong
There's nowhere I'd rather be
We shine for liberty, life,
And the pursuit of pleasure

* Repeat Gone & blown it all, and then you say
"THIS ISN'T HAPPENING TO ME"
A dumb mistake, too much to pay
A shattered heart in love's debris

...here I do walk, fret amongst the flowers
...on a cold summer's day, on a cold summer's day
...fret amongst the flowers
...I never said that, I never said that... the word that counts

* Repeat How the days have flown too few & fast
They said it wasn't meant to last
A dumb mistake, too much to pay
A shattered heart in love's debris

...how the days have gone ...said it wouldn't last
...was too much to ask ...hearts made of glass
...the love that saved the day ...see it go away
...like a shattered heart

A shattered heart in love's debris.
