Ran out of limbs on our big day
We left our thumbs in the hotel
I hurried back in your red shoes
But on the door was a sign

We're not alive, we're not alive
We're not at home for preg-er-nant callers (callers)
We're not alive, we're not alive
We're not at home for preg-er-nant callers (callers)

And then the tale took a tall turn
The devil thumb made a man a slave
We traveled north to our new hutch
And on the door was a sign

We're not alive, we're not alive
We're not at home for pregnant callers (callers)
We're not alive, we're not alive
We're not at home for pregnant callers (callers)

My body double
My body double
My body fried, they'll never take it alive
