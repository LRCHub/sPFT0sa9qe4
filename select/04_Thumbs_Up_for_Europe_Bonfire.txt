There's a new kind of challenge
It's colours are gold and blue
It's got a circle of stars
Shining for me and you

Let's all give it a shot
Ready or not
It's our destiny

Human blood is one colour
So let's make history

It's just a little step
In mankindís dream
One world united - in liberty

CHORUS
Thumbs up for Europe
Thumbs up for Europe
Thumbs up for Europe - you and me
Thumbs up Germany

So just say what you mean
And mean what you say - or shut up
It takes a whole lot of courage
To kill all your &quotifs" and &quotbuts"

I don't say that it's easy
We gotta be tough
So c'mon everybody - we're kickin' off

CHORUS
