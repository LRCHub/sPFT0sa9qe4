```
Somewhere in the world there is
a father and a mother
And the father is a son who has
a mother
And the mother has a daughter
who gets married to
The brother of a mother
And they all just try to
multiply with one another
'Cause that's just the way of
the world
It never ends till the end, then
you start again
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world
Somewhere in the world they
think they work all for
themselves
They get up every day to go to
work for someone else
And somebody works for them and
so they think they got a maid
But they're all just working to
get paid the very same
And so they keep on twiddling
them thumbs
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddling
them thumbs
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum)
And so they keep on twiddling
them thumbs
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum,
skiddly-dee-da-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddling
them thumbs
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum)
Somewhere in the world you got a
robber and a bank
And the bank robbed the people
so the people robbed the bank
And the police came to get him
but they let him get away
'Cause they're all just working
to get paid the very same
'Cause that's just the way of
the world
It never ends till the end, then
you start again
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world
And so they keep on twiddling
them thumbs
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum,
skiddly-dee-da-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddling
them thumbs
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum)
And so they keep on twiddling
them thumbs
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum,
skiddly-dee-da-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddling
them thumbs
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum)
Don't believe everything that
you hear
Let it go through your left and
right ear
Don't just march to the beat of
that drum
Don't be one of them people just
twiddling them thumbs
'Cause that's just the way of
the world
It never ends till the end and
then you start again
That's just the way of the world
That's just the way of the world
And so they keep on twiddling
them thumbs
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum,
skiddly-dee-da-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddling
them thumbs
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum)
And so they keep on twiddling
them thumbs
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum,
skiddly-dee-da-dum)
They gonna keep on twiddling
them thumbs
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum)
And so they keep on twiddling
them thumbs (They keep on, keep
on)
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum)
(They keep on, keep on)
They gonna keep on twiddling
them thumbs
(Skiddly-dee-da-dum-dum)
'Cause that's just the way of
the world
